# get_next_line

## Project Overview

The `get-next-line` project focuses on implementing a function that reads a single line ending with a newline character ('\n') from a file descriptor. The function is designed to handle lines of unknown length, dynamically managing memory as needed.

## Objectives

### Dynamic Line Reading: 

Create a function that efficiently reads a line from a file descriptor, regardless of its length, and terminates when encountering a newline character.

### Learn C Programming Concepts:

   - **Static Variables**: Gain insights into the use of static variables and their implications on function behavior and memory management.
   - **Memory Allocation**: Understand the differences between stack and heap memory allocation, and how to effectively manage and manipulate memory buffers.
   - **Buffer Lifecycle**: Explore the complexities involved in buffer management, including allocation, resizing, and deallocation.
